# snake_game_python
This is a nostalgic classic snake game built using the Pygame module in Python3.

ðŸ’¾ This game is built with the help of a pygame tutorial course by CodeWithHarry.

ðŸ’¾  There are two modes in the game - Easy and Hard.

ðŸ’¾  Each mode has their separate scoring system.

ðŸ’¾  The high scores are stored in a 'score.json' file.

ðŸ’¾  Audio 'eat.mp3' is used to provide the eating sound when snake eats(collides) with food and 'over.mp3' is used when the player loses the game.

*Note:  Both audio devices must be kept in the same path of the game file.
